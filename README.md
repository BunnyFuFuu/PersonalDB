# PersonalDB
This is intended to be the backend to my personal website. It's going to hold JSONs of my hobbies, experiences, and side projects, which anyone can view but only I can edit or create in any form.

Realized really quick that I'm the only one managing any write operations so actually validation may not be as necessary as it was in the Philanthropy Connect project. As long as my admin interface limits it fairly well I should be alright with just raw implementation. Additionally, I am implementing a few redundancies (highly unlikely I'm using the delete endpoint)
